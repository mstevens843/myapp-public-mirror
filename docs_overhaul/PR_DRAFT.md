# Docs Overhaul PR Draft

This pull request introduces a comprehensive documentation overhaul for the trading bot.  It reorganises the existing content into an app‑wide docs set, replaces turbo‑centric guides with multi‑strategy references and adds missing topics such as deployment, configuration, performance tuning, testing, troubleshooting and subscriptions.

## Summary of Changes

- Added a new **README.md** outlining the project overview, features, quick start and repository map.
- Created **CONTRIBUTING.md**, **CHANGELOG.md**, **LICENSE**, markdown linting and spell‑check configuration files.
- Added PR and issue templates under `.github/` with structured checklists.
- Replaced the old `updated_docs` with a new `docs/` structure containing the following:
  - Architecture, configuration reference, deployment, security, CORS, API, authentication, wallet encryption, Telegram, trading, bot strategies (with Turbo Sniper isolated), performance, testing, troubleshooting, onboarding and subscriptions guides.
  - A dedicated `docs/strategies/turbo.md` capturing the Turbo Sniper pipeline, knobs, error classes and fallback logic.
  - Example files under `docs/examples/` including a comprehensive `.env.example`, an Express CORS snippet, a Docker Compose stack and an OpenAPI YAML scaffold.
- Added a **PR_DRAFT.md** (this file) describing the overhaul and checklists for review.
- Generated **MANIFEST.json** and **DIFF_SUMMARY.md** to catalogue the new files and summarise key changes.

## Checklists

### Documentation Deliverables

* [x] README.md – project overview, features, quick start and repo map.
* [x] CONTRIBUTING.md – conventions, PR flow and style guide.
* [x] CHANGELOG.md – seeded with initial release notes.
* [x] LICENSE – placeholder license (“All rights reserved”).

```

## How to Review

1. Read the new README to understand the structure and usage of the project.
2. Browse through the new `docs/` directory; each file includes cross‑links to related topics.
3. Review the examples in `docs/examples/` and adapt them to your environment.
4. Run markdown lint, link check and spell check locally to verify there are no errors.
5. Provide feedback via comments or update the docs directly.

## Final Notes

This overhaul aims to bring the documentation from “3/10” to “10/10.”  It is comprehensive, multi‑strategy friendly and designed to help new users, operators and contributors get up to speed quickly.  Please review thoroughly and suggest any improvements or corrections.
