/**
 * backend/services/execution/blockhashPrewarm.js
 *
 * A lightweight utility to continuously prewarm and cache the most
 * recent blockhash from a Solana RPC connection.  In order to
 * construct transactions quickly it is important to have a fresh
 * blockhash on hand.  This module exposes two functions:
 *
 *   - startBlockhashPrewarm({ connection, intervalMs, ttlMs }):
 *     begins a background loop which periodically fetches a new
 *     blockhash from the provided connection.  The returned object
 *     exposes a stop() method that can be invoked to cancel the
 *     interval.  The interval will fetch immediately once at
 *     start and then again every `intervalMs` milliseconds.
 *
 *   - getCachedBlockhash():
 *     returns the most recently cached blockhash information or
 *     null if the cached entry is stale beyond the configured
 *     time-to-live.  The returned object has the shape:
 *       { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight, ts }
 *     where `ts` is a timestamp (ms since epoch) when the blockhash
 *     was fetched.  Consumers should check for null and fall back
 *     to `connection.getLatestBlockhash()` as needed.
 */

'use strict';

// Internal storage for the cached blockhash.  Each entry tracks
// the blockhash, its last valid block height and the timestamp when
// it was refreshed.  The ttlMs is persisted alongside for stale
// expiry calculations.

let _intervalId = null;

/**
 * Starts the background refresh loop.  This function kicks off
 * an immediate fetch of the latest blockhash and continues to fetch
 * at the supplied interval.  A handle with a stop() method is
 * returned which should be called to clean up the timer when the
 * strategy is shut down or during tests.
 *
 * @param {Object} params
 * @param {Object} params.connection A Solana RPC connection with

 *   considered fresh in ms.  If a consumer calls getCachedBlockhash()
 *   after the ttl has elapsed the function will return null.
 * @returns {{stop: Function}} A handle that can be used to stop
 *   the refresh loop.
