 * Execute a potentially long-running job exactly once given an idempotency
 * key. Duplicate calls with the same key within the TTL window will receive
 * the cached result. When no key is supplied the job runs immediately and
 * isn’t cached.
 *
 * The job is executed with a retry mechanism: when the job throws an error
 * (aside from manual abort via timeout) it will retry up to `maxRetries`
 * times with exponential backoff and jitter. A timeout is applied to each
 * attempt. If all attempts fail the error is propagated to the caller and
 * cached so subsequent duplicate calls also return the error.
 *
 * @param {string|null} idKey A unique idempotency identifier provided by the client
 * @param {function(): Promise<{status:number,response:any}>} jobFn The async
 *   function encapsulating the business logic. It should return an object
 *   with `status` and `response` fields. Throwing will trigger a retry.
 * @param {object} opts Optional settings: { timeoutMs, maxRetries }
