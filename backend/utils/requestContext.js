/*
 * Simple AsyncLocalStorage-based request context helper.
 *
 * This module provides a mechanism to propagate per-request
 * metadata, such as the `req.id` identifier assigned in
 * `middleware/requestId.js`, across asynchronous boundaries.
 *
 * The context is initialised for each incoming request via
 * the requestId middleware.  Downstream modules can then call
 * `getReqId()` to retrieve the current request ID without
 * explicitly threading it through every function call.  This is
 * particularly useful for logging and external HTTP calls where
 * correlating logs with the originating request is important.
