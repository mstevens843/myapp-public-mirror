That's a very smart idea — and a highly practical one.

✅ Why This Is a Great Idea
Helping users prepare their crypto tax reports automatically is a real painkiller — because:

Manual tracking of trades is time-consuming and error-prone

Most people don’t know how to calculate gains/losses

Third-party tools (like Koinly, TokenTax) are often paid and complicated

You already log everything (entry, exit, USD value, strategy, PnL, etc.)

This is a natural extension of your existing logging + export system.

💡 What a “Crypto Tax CSV” Should Include
To make your CSV “tax tool ready,” you'd want to include columns like:

Field	Purpose
timestamp	Date/time of the trade
type	Buy or Sell
tokenName	Human-readable name (fallback to mint)
mint	Token mint address
amount	How many tokens (buy/sell amount)
entryPriceUSD	Price when entering trade (USD per token)
exitPriceUSD	Price when exiting trade (USD per token)
grossProceeds	Sell amount × exit price (total revenue from sale)
costBasis	Buy amount × entry price (cost of acquiring it)
gainLossUSD	Gross proceeds - Cost basis
strategy	Optional, for tax optimization (FIFO vs strategy)
txHash	TX hash (for audit trail)

These help calculate capital gains per trade — what the tax report is based on.

🛠️ How Much Work Is It?
Here’s the effort breakdown:

✅ Already Done
Logging all trades

Exporting as CSV

Capturing key metadata: entry/exit, USD values, amount, etc.

🟡 Needs Doing
Add missing fields to CSV export (like tokenName, type, gainLossUSD)

Optionally allow per-year export (e.g. filter trades for 2024 only)

Add endpoint like /api/tax/export?year=2024

Add optional file-per-strategy or FIFO vs LIFO toggles later

Estimated Time
MVP tax CSV export: ~30–60 mins

Full tax config UI + filters: ~1–2 days depending on depth

🧩 Suggested Next Step
Would you like me to:

✅ Modify your convertToCSV() function to include tax-ready fields

✅ Rename it to exportForTax() or keep dual format (basic + tax CSV)?

✅ Add /api/tax/export route that optionally accepts ?year=2024

This would give you:

📤 “Export Tax CSV” button → with gains/losses, date filters, audit trail.

Let me know which you'd like me to do first.
