      <p className="mb-4">
        SolPulse (‚ÄúSolPulse,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) values your privacy and is
        committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy describes
        how we collect, use, store, and disclose information when you access or
        use any of our websites, trading tools, APIs, mobile or web
        applications, and related services (collectively, the ‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù). As a
        non‚Äëcustodial trading platform, we do not take possession of your
        assets or private keys. You remain in full control of your wallets at
        all times, but certain data you provide or that we collect may still
        constitute personal data under applicable privacy laws„Äê69742131230746‚Ä†L144-L152„Äë.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">

        We do <b>not</b> require full know‚Äëyour‚Äëcustomer (KYC) verification for
        most users because our Platform is non‚Äëcustodial. However, regulations
        may change; we reserve the right to request additional information to
