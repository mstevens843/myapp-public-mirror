      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-zinc-400">Last Updated: August 4, 2025</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding
        agreement between you (“you” or “User”) and SolPulse (“SolPulse,”
        “we,” “our,” or “us”). These Terms govern your use of our websites,
        trading tools, APIs, mobile or web applications, and other services
        provided by SolPulse (collectively, the “Platform”). By accessing or
        using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
        and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must
        not use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You may use the Platform only if you are at least 18 years of age and
        have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract. You are
        solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Platform
        complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you. Access to
        the Platform may not be legal for certain persons or in certain
        countries. If use of the Platform is prohibited by law in your
        jurisdiction, you must not use it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">2. Use of the Platform</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Platform is provided for your personal and lawful use only. You
        agree that you will not:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Use the Platform for any unlawful or fraudulent purpose, including activities that violate anti‑money laundering or sanctions laws</li>
        <li>Engage in market manipulation, front‑running, pump‑and‑dump schemes, or other abusive trading practices【240496510653831†L132-L149】</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Platform, or attempt to circumvent any measures we use to prevent or restrict access</li>
        <li>Transmit viruses, worms, or other malicious code</li>
        <li>Use robots, scrapers, or other automated means not provided by us to access the Platform in a manner that sends more requests to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period</li>
        <li>Use another User’s account without permission or share your own account credentials</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">3. Web3 Access & Wallets</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        SolPulse is a **non‑custodial** platform: we do not hold or control your
        cryptocurrency or private keys. You are solely responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Generating, maintaining, and safeguarding your own private keys, seed phrases, and wallet credentials</li>
        <li>Reviewing each transaction (including swaps and approvals) before confirming it</li>
        <li>Backing up any vault keys or secrets generated within the Platform (if you choose to generate a vault); we may show these secrets to you once and cannot recover them if lost</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 italic text-zinc-400">
        Because the Platform is non‑custodial, losing access to your private keys or vault secrets will permanently prevent you from accessing your assets. We have no ability to reset, retrieve, or restore lost keys or funds.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">4. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Certain features of the Platform are available only through paid
        subscriptions. When you sign up for a subscription, you agree to the
        pricing, billing terms, and payment schedule presented at checkout.
        Subscriptions may be offered in fiat currency (processed via Stripe or
        other third‑party payment processors) or in cryptocurrency. You
        authorise us and our payment processors to charge the payment method
        you provide. All fees are non‑refundable except as required by
        applicable law. We may change our prices or discontinue subscriptions
        at any time; we will provide reasonable notice of any material
        changes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">5. Risk Disclosure</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        **Trading risk.** The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile. Prices
        can swing dramatically over very short periods of time, leading to
        significant gains or losses【240496510653831†L52-L60】. Regulatory changes,
        liquidity fluctuations, news events, hacks, and market manipulation
        can all impact the value of digital assets【240496510653831†L72-L90】. By
        using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>You are solely responsible for your trading and investment decisions and assume all risk associated with those decisions</li>
        <li>You may lose some or all of your capital; there is no guarantee of profit</li>
        <li>Past performance of a strategy or market does not guarantee future results</li>
        <li>Market manipulation, pump‑and‑dump schemes, and other fraudulent activities may affect asset prices; you should conduct your own research and remain vigilant【240496510653831†L132-L149】</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-yellow-400">
        SolPulse provides software tools and automation. We are **not** a
        broker‑dealer, investment adviser, or financial advisor. Nothing on
        the Platform constitutes financial advice. Please consult a qualified
        professional before making investment decisions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">6. Compliance & Regulatory Status</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        SolPulse provides a non‑custodial trading interface. We do not take
        possession of your funds or private keys. As noted in legal guidance
        for non‑custodial wallets, providers that simply facilitate access to
        blockchain networks without holding users’ assets generally do not
        require money transmitter or similar licences【69742131230746†L144-L152】. Nevertheless, laws and regulations regarding
        digital assets are evolving. You are responsible for determining
        whether use of the Platform is permitted under the laws of your
        jurisdiction and for complying with any applicable licensing,
        registration, tax, or reporting obligations. We reserve the right to
        implement KYC/AML procedures or other compliance measures as
        necessary to meet legal requirements【69742131230746†L156-L169】.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">7. No Warranty</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Platform and all related services are provided on an “as is” and
        “as available” basis without warranty of any kind. To the fullest
        extent permitted by law, SolPulse disclaims all warranties, express
        or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability,
        fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, non‑infringement, and
        uninterrupted or error‑free operation. We do not guarantee the
        availability, timeliness, completeness, or reliability of any
        information or of the trading strategies offered through the
        Platform. You use the Platform at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, SolPulse and its directors,
        employees, agents, and affiliates will not be liable to you for any
        indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages
        arising out of or in connection with your use of the Platform, even if
        we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This
        limitation applies to, but is not limited to, any loss of profits,
        revenue, data, business interruption, or other economic advantage. In
        no event shall our aggregate liability exceed the greater of (a) the
        amount you paid to us in the twelve months preceding the claim, or (b)
        one hundred US dollars (USD $100). Some jurisdictions do not allow
        limitations on implied warranties or liability; in such jurisdictions,
        our liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">9. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All intellectual property rights in the Platform, including but not
        limited to code, branding, UI, and documentation, remain the property of
        SolPulse. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any
        part of the Platform without permission.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">10. Termination & Suspension</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Platform at
        any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated
        these Terms, engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity, or if your use
        of the Platform poses a security or regulatory risk. You agree that we
        will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of
        your access. Upon termination, your right to use the Platform ceases
        immediately. Any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should
        survive termination (including ownership rights, warranty
        disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute
        resolution) shall remain in effect.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SolPulse and its
        directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any
        claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including
        reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or related to (a) your
        use or misuse of the Platform, (b) your violation of these Terms,
        (c) your violation of any rights of another person or entity, or (d)
        your violation of any applicable law or regulation. We reserve the
        right to assume exclusive control of any matter otherwise subject to
        indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate with
        our defence.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These Terms, and any dispute arising out of or in connection with the
        Platform or these Terms, shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to
        conflict of law principles. You agree that any dispute, claim, or
        controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof
        (collectively, “Disputes”) shall be resolved by binding arbitration
        administered by a recognized arbitration provider in a location within
        the United States. The arbitration shall be conducted on an
        individual basis and not on a class or representative basis. You
        understand that by agreeing to arbitrate disputes, you are waiving
        your right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action. If
        this arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable, then all
        Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
        federal and state courts located in the United States, and you
        consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">13. Changes to Terms</h2>
